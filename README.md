# MTVE - Magdeburg Tool for Videoexperiments

MTVE is a software tool (citeware) for economic experiments facilitating researchers to gather
video data from communication-based experiments in a way that these can be later used for
automatic analysis through machine learning techniques. 
It is developed by the [Magdeburg Experimental Laboratory of Economic Research of the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](https://maxlab.ovgu.de/). If you have questions, please feel free to contact us: maxlab@ovgu.de.

When you report results of experiments conducted with MTVE, the licence requires that you mention its use in your publication and cite our Paper. The correct citation is:
